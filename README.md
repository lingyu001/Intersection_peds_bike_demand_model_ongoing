# Intersection_peds_bike_demand_model_ongoing
Develop the demand models to predict pedestrian and bike volume for Minneapolis urban intersections. This is an on-going project and the data are confidential.

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Develop the predictive models to forecast pedestrain and bike volumes at intersections. The results are used to adjust signal timing, intersection improvement.
2. Identify important spatial factors that impact the pedestrain and bike demand, such factors includes population density, education levels, land use diversity, household number of vehicles,street types, etc.

The analysis focus on:
1. Pick the a better model function form between negative binomial and log-linear models.
2. Search the important features by feature selections.
3. Conduct cross-validation to pick the best models and feature combinations.
