# Intersection_peds_bike_demand_model
Develop the demand models to predict pedestrian and bike volume for Minneapolis urban intersections. This is an on-going project and the data are confidential.

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Develop the predictive models to forecast pedestrain and bike volumes at intersections. The results are used to adjust signal timing, intersection improvement.
2. Identify important spatial factors that impact the pedestrain and bike demand, such factors includes population density, education levels, land use diversity, household number of vehicles,street types, etc.

The analysis focus on:
1. Rank and identify the important features that impact intersection travel demand.
2. Develop bike and pedestrian demand predictive models and estimate the effect of land-use and facility features.
3. Conduct cross-validation to select the best model.
